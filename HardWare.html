            <p>
                The current COVID-19 detection platforms have problems 
                such as cumbersome operation, large body size, they need 
                to be equipped with professional operators, and are 
                limited to use in central laboratories. Therefore, a 
                visual detection hardware device that is simple to 
                operate and easy to carry and can be used in communities, 
                rural hospitals and homes is very necessary. In the initial 
                design of the project, the biological part was designed to 
                jointly detect the nucleic acid and protein markers of the novel 
                coronavirus. The centrifugal chip plans to integrate all the 
                steps of the novel coronavirus detection into the chip, and 
                realize the following three functions at the same time: 
                pre-processing of the sample to be tested, signal amplification 
                of the target molecule, and signal visualization detection. 
                Thus, the original centrifugal chip module can be divided 
                into a sample pre-processing area, an isothermal amplification 
                area, and a signal detection and transduction area based on 
                the specific biosensing function implemented. Meanwhile, for 
                the application scenarios of instant inspection, we further 
                design:

                Reagent consumables required are pre-processed in the chip 
                in advance, and those for different targets are stored or 
                embedded in different sectors. When it is finally delivered 
                to the client for use, the client only need to add samples, 
                and perform simple operations in accordance with the established 
                process to achieve the release of liquid reagents, the dissolution 
                of solid reagents, and the use of consumables without additional 
                reagents or consumables.

                Initially, the project envisages that after users use the sample, 
                they will first go to the sample pre-processing part. In the 
                pre-processing part of the sample, for the protein to be tested in the
                sample, our project plans to complete the pre-processing steps of cell 
                lysis and aptamer replacement before sample injection. After cell lysis, 
                the aptamer replacement system for N protein or S protein can be used to 
                process the protein signal into nucleic acid signal. For the processing 
                of nucleic acid signals, in the early stage of our project design, we 
                considered extracting and purifying them by magnetic bead method. The 
                fine separation of magnetically responsive particles using the movement 
                of particles induced by a magnetic field, that is, magnetophoresis, 
                is an effective technology developed in recent years to selectively 
                separate cells and high molecular weight nucleic acids. The target 
                biomolecules labeled with magnetic particles separated by the magnetic 
                separation device can be directly used for subsequent analysis and testing.

                In the signal detection part, the initial plan of the project is 
                to use external equipment to build and design a fluorescence detection 
                unit based on the mobile phone platform. In terms of fluorescence detection 
                method, we plan to adopt oblique incidence fluorescence detection method 
                which is conducive to miniaturization. We use SOLIDWORKS for 3D modeling, 
                design a box that can be equipped with a microfluidic chip and a mobile 
                phone holder that matches different mobile phone models, and subsequently 
                could design an adjustable mobile phone holder to match different mobile 
                phone models. Moreover, in addition to using the LED light source that 
                comes with the mobile phone, an LED light source using a button battery 
                is added as the light source to the mobile phone holder to ensure the 
                stability of the light source.

                Finally, it is planned to use 3D printing technology to complete 
                the model. The figure below shows a mobile phone holder that matches 
                a single model of mobile phone.

                In the drive design of the centrifugal chip, the initial plan of the project 
                is to adopt a whistle-type centrifugal chip design scheme based on the "whistle 
                principle". Punch holes on both sides of the chip shell and fix the two bungee 
                cords, then pull the bungee cord by external force to switch between "winding" 
                and "unfolding", which can pull the centrifugal disc chip to produce a certain 
                rotation speed and centrifugal force (speed can reach 125,000 rpm, and the 
                equivalent centrifugal force is 30,000 g)[1], so as to achieve hydraulic drive, 
                In addition, microvalves are set at bayonet ports in different areas to ensure 
                the directional movement of the fluid and make the fluid stay and work in a 
                specific area.

            <p>
                In the final experimental stage of the project, we conducted experimental 
                verification on the manual whistle driving method adopted in the initial 
                plan, and found that the driving method based on the whistle principle has 
                problems such as poor stability, easy leakage, and structural instability. 
                Under the conditions of manual centrifugation, this project is finally 
                implemented to drive the microfluidic chip through a fingertip gyro[2], 
                which can control the centrifugal drive more stably. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                For the sample pre-treatment area planned to be built at the beginning of 
                the project, if we need to perform multiple reactions in the microfluidic 
                chip and build multiple chambers, it will be difficult to control the liquid 
                path, and we need to add microvalves and other structures for control. 
                Considering the streamlining of the microfluidic chip structure and the 
                ease of controlling the liquid path, this project was finally implemented 
                as the two steps of the cell lysis step and the conversion of protein 
                signals into nucleic acid signals before the microfluidic chip injection.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                In the extraction of nucleic acid, the magnetic bead method mainly 
                includes four steps of lysis, binding, washing and elution. Through 
                literature research, we found that the operation steps of the magnetic 
                bead method in the microfluidic chip are more complicated, so the magnetic
                bead method has higher requirements for liquid path control and reaction 
                process control. In the current experiment, the efficiency of nucleic 
                acid extraction by the magnetic bead method in the chip is not high. 
                And at the same time, through experiments conducted in the microfluidic 
                chip, the amplified signal of the nucleic acid signal that does not pass 
                the magnetic bead method is detected, we find that it can already meet 
                the needs of detection. Our project is finally implemented as direct 
                amplification of unpurified nucleic acid signals.  
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Corresponding to the changes in the above design ideas, we only 
                need to consider the two functions of the pre-processing of the sample 
                to be tested in the structural design of the centrifugal chip, the 
                signal amplification of the target molecule and the signal visualization 
                detection. Therefore, the chip we designed mainly contains nucleic acid 
                The two major structures of the amplification chamber and the test strip 
                chamber, as well as the injection port and microchannels.    
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                The design of the amplification chamber is relatively simple, and it 
                only needs to cooperate with the temperature control module of the 
                mobile phone to provide a suitable temperature for the chamber. After 
                the nucleic acid signal is amplified by the RCA and HCR technology in 
                the previous part, the biological signal needs to be converted into a 
                visual light signal. Therefore, the main function of the test strip is 
                to use colloidal gold technology and lateral tomography technology to 
                realize the energy conversion path, so as to perform more accurate 
                detection of experimental results. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                In the detection part, the mobile phone holder and detection light path 
                designed in the first version of the project have problems such as 
                difficulty in experimental verification and unstable position parameters 
                of different mobile phone cameras. Resulting from the need of portable 
                equipment, we retain the colloidal gold technology for testing, upload 
                the photos taken to the mini program, analyze the R value of colloidal 
                gold, and compare with the standard positive value to get the final result.

            <br>
            <p>
                In our project, a microfluidic chip driven by a fingertip gyro is used 
                as a reaction carrier to realize the biological part. The manufacturing 
                material is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and the chip is assembled by 
                hot-key bonding method. The overall frame of our microfluidic chip can 
                be approximately regarded as a rectangle, the turning radius is slightly 
                smaller than the average length of the adult hand gap, and there is a 
                rotating shaft composed of a roller bearing and a gasket in the center of 
                the chip. By holding the gasket in the center and rotating the chip with 
                the other hand, the centrifugal force generated by the rotation can be used 
                to drive the liquid path of the microfluidic chip. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                According to the biological part of the detection process, this project 
                decided to perform sample pre-processing steps such as cell lysis, 
                release of contents, and protein signal conversion outside the chip. 
                On the basis of the microfluidic chip, we successively realize the 
                isothermal amplification of nucleic acid in the isothermal amplification
                area, and realize the visual signal conversion based on the lateral 
                chromatography test strip in the signal detection area. Finally, the 
                mobile phone support module optically detects the signal on the test 
                strip, and performs subsequent signal processing. Specifically, on 
                the test strip, our project adopts a signal conversion method based 
                on colloidal gold technology, and compares the colloidal gold degree 
                with the standard positive result through the color reaction to obtain 
                the reaction result.  
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                The temperature control module is mainly composed of a single-chip 
                microcomputer, a ceramic heater and a thermistor. The combination of 
                these three can meet our temperature requirements for HCR and RCA 
                reactions.  
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                In the optical signal visual detection part, we use the MINA framework 
                to build a WeChat applet to take pictures and upload the colloidal gold 
                test strips, as well as reading the fluorescence image with the software, 
                and fitting the relationship between the image characteristics and the 
                concentration of the test object, and finally get the virus test results.

                According to the definition of George Whitesides, microfluidic technology 
                is a technology that uses channels of tens to hundreds of microns in size 
                to process or manipulate a small amount of fluid. On this micro-scale, the 
                surface characteristics of the equipment will be extremely magnified, which 
                undoubtedly may give it unique functions and cause problems that will not 
                be encountered on the macro-scale.[3] In addition, the difference of each 
                material also determines the physical characteristics, biological 
                characteristics and processing methods of this microfluidic device. 
                Therefore, we need to pay special attention to the materials used to 
                manufacture microfluidic chips and compare their properties and preparation 
                methods.

                In this year's project, we make a microfluidic chip for rapid detection 
                of COVID-19. In order to meet the epidemic prevention requirements, the 
                chip is designed to disposable. At the same time, since we choose 
                fluorescence detection as the detection method, we have high requirements 
                on the light transmittance of the chip material. In this context, our 
                microfluidic chip materials will choose PMMA with low prices and simple 
                manufacturing methods. While making full use of its advantages such as 
                good light permeability, strong bio-friendliness, simple manufacturing 
                and low cost, it avoids the defects of being easily contaminated by 
                reagents, difficult to clean, and low reusability.

                As a material that is widely used in industry, the processing and 
                manufacturing process of PMMA has been mature, and its processing 
                method is simple and easy and the micro-manufacturing cost is low.

                According to the centrifugal chip layer we designed, we can obtain 
                1-4 layers of different structures. In order to ensure the cleanliness 
                of the chamber after the chip is bonded, the surface is cleaned with 
                absolute ethanol and deionized water in sequence. After cleaning, wipe 
                off the remaining water stains with lens cleaning paper, place the 
                chip layers in the glass plate in order, fix each layer of the chip 
                with solid micro pins, cover another layer of glass plate and clamp 
                it. Place it in a 170°C environment and heat it for 10 minutes, take 
                out the fixed micro pins and heat it for 5 minutes to complete the 
                bonding of the chip to obtain the required microfluidic chip. Finally, 
                place the rolling bearing in the center of the chip to complete the 
                centrifugal chip processing.

              Based on the designed biological part, the centrifugal chip module needs 
              to integrate the following functions: target molecule signal amplification 
              and signal visual detection. Therefore, the centrifugal chip module can 
              be divided into an isothermal amplification zone and a signal detection 
              and transduction zone according to the specific biosensing function realized. 
              For the sample pretreatment of the microfluidic chip, this project decided 
              to take the steps of cell lysis, release of contents, and protein signal 
              conversion outside the chip. In the nucleic acid signal amplification part, 
              HCR and RCA amplification technology are adopted, the pre-processed sample 
              is added to RNase and proteinase K, and the mixed solution is directly injected 
              into the RPA amplification chamber through a pipette for amplification.

                The overall construction frame of the disc chip is a disc-like disc, 
                and the manufacturing material is made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). 
                The center of the disc is composed of a roller bearing and its central 
                solid shaft and a gasket. The driving method is similar to a fingertip 
                top. The microfluidic chip is rotated by holding the gasket and pushing 
                with the other hand. The chip uses the kinetic energy transmitted by 
                the pusher and converts it into centrifugal force to drive the sample 
                into the next chamber.

                Our project is based on solidworks software to design the chip structure, 
                as shown in the figure below. The chip is designed with a micro-reaction 
                chamber, a micro-channel and a hole, and contains two symmetrical detection 
                modules, which can simultaneously detect two independent samples. The micro 
                device is composed of four layers of 2 mm PMMA boards, which are connected 
                as a whole by means of hot-key bonding method. The first layer contains the 
                sample inlet, the second layer contains part of the nucleic acid amplification 
                chamber and test strip chamber and microchannels, the third layer contains part 
                of the nucleic acid amplification chamber and test strip chamber, and the 
                fourth layer is only Test strip chamber. The sequence of the liquid path is 
                the injection port, the nucleic acid amplification chamber, and the test 
                strip chamber. The radius of the nucleic acid amplification chamber is about 
                5mm. In the nucleic acid amplification chamber, the sample is subjected to 
                isothermal amplification at a constant temperature (provided by the mobile 
                phone module device). At the same time, during the actual use of the RPA 
                nucleic acid amplification area, surface modification treatment is also 
                required to prevent the reaction mixture from directly contacting the inner 
                surface of the channel, avoiding the surface adsorption of biological/chemical 
                particles, and preventing microfluidic interference. Inhibition of nucleic acid 
                amplification and carryover contamination. The size of the test strip chamber is 
                3.9mm*59mm, which is used to store the test strip for subsequent testing 
                operations.

                After the sample is added, hot melt glue or sealing film is used to seal 
                the chip injection port, and the sample is injected into the nucleic 
                acid amplification chamber, and isothermal amplification is performed 
                in the mobile phone module. After the amplification is completed, the 
                microfluidic chip is turned upside down and rotated, and the sample will 
                be driven by centrifugal force to flow into the test strip chamber for the 
                next step of detection. By controlling the amount of sample entering the 
                microfluidic chip, the height of the sample chamber after adding the reaction 
                system will not reach the second layer of microchannels, so the sample will 
                not enter the test strip area in advance. Due to the pseudo-centrifugal 
                effect, the test strip will be subjected to gravity and centrifugal force 
                away from the axis. At the same time, because the chamber size is slightly 
                smaller than the test strip by 0.2mm, the test strip will be stuck inside 
                to ensure that the test strip will not fall.

                Based on the previous model construction, we have manufactured a prototype 
                of a centrifugal microfluidic chip, as shown in the figure below. In this 
                chip, we did not install a spacer, but directly held the solid center shaft 
                to rotate. Preliminary experiments have shown that the chip can maintain a 
                basically stable rotation and speed when the central shaft is held in hand.

                After the nucleic acid signal is amplified by the previous RCA and HCR 
                technology, the biological signal needs to be converted into a visual 
                light signal. Therefore, the main function of the signal detection and 
                transduction area in the microfluidic chip is to use lateral chromatography 
                test strip technology and colloidal gold technology to realize the 
                transduction path, so as to perform more accurate detection of the 
                experimental results.

                Lateral chromatography technology uses a large-pore microporous membrane 
                (NC membrane, nitrocellulose membrane) as a carrier to fix specific antigens, 
                antibodies or nucleic acid probes on the NC membrane. When the sample to be 
                tested is added to the sample pad at one end of the test strip, it moves 
                laterally through capillary action, and a specific immune reaction occurs 
                with the colloidal gold or fluorescent microsphere-labeled reagent on the 
                binding pad. Then it moves to the NC membrane, being captured by the antigen, 
                antibody or nucleic acid probe immobilized on the NC membrane surface, 
                and gathers on the detection belt. By visually observing the density of 
                the light reflection signal of the nitrocellulose surface marker (colloidal 
                gold), intuitive color results can be obtained. Other unbound markers cross 
                the detection zone and flow into the absorbent pad to achieve the purpose of 
                automatic separation. After the microfluidic chip drives the pre-processed 
                sample to the isothermal amplification zone for amplification, the detection 
                system needs to extract the information from the processed sample and convert 
                it into the final result[4].

                This project designed a detection method based on lateral flow chromatography 
                test strips. The method process includes the following three steps: sample 
                preparation, immune response, and colloidal gold detection. We need to add 
                the sample to be tested to the lateral flow test paper, capture the sample 
                to be tested on the test line of the lateral flow test paper through 
                immunochromatographic reaction, and finally diagnose whether the sample 
                has novel coronavirus through color development.

                Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay (GICA) is a solid-phase 
                labeling immunoassay technology that organically combines colloidal gold 
                labeling technology, immunodetection technology and chromatography analysis 
                technology. It has the characteristics of simplicity, time saving, less sample 
                usage, and easy interpretation of results. It is a lateral immunochromatographic 
                method that uses colloidal gold as a tracer to determine the target qualitatively 
                or quantitatively. The most suitable colloidal gold particle size for immunoassay 
                is 20-40nm, and the colloidal gold in this particle size range is ruby color. It 
                is negatively charged under alkaline conditions and can bind to the protein 
                through electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction, and does not affect the activity 
                of the conjugate. During detection, the sample is added to the sample pad at the 
                end of the test paper and moved forward by capillary action. The analyte in the 
                sample interacts with the immune colloidal gold on the binding pad and forms a 
                complex. The complex moves to the detection line, specifically binds to the 
                antibody (or antigen) on it, and is retained, and aggregates on the detection 
                line. When the complex accumulates to a certain amount, it shows a red color 
                characteristic of colloidal gold. The immunocolloidal gold that is not bound to 
                the analyte is not captured by the detection line, and migrates to the quality 
                control line and binds to the antibody on it to show red, achieving the purpose 
                of separating from the complex, and indicating that the test paper is working 
                properly.[5]

                subjected to the HCR reaction in a 37°C incubator in advance. The volumes 
                of the three solutions are 15 μL, 70 μL, and 15 μL, totaling 100 μL. Inject

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Our temperature control module can provide our amplification with stable 
                temperature, the commonly used PCR amplification on the temperature change 
                after heating denaturation and annealing of two steps, which requires the 
                device in the temperature control needs to have the ability of rapid heating 
                and cooling, which means you need larger space to provide equipment heat 
                dissipation of the environment, but also has great power to provide our 
                equipment.However, because of our need for miniaturization and portability, 
                we did not adopt PCR as our amplification technology. Instead, we adopted 
                an amplification method with low requirement for temperature change to meet 
                our demand for portability. This amplification method only needs to be 
                amplified at constant temperature. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Since the amplification temperature we needed was constant, we initially 
                considered whether we could use human body to amplify the nucleic acid 
                temperature of our chip. However, considering the biosafety and stable 
                temperature required for amplification, we looked elsewhere.Finally, we 
                chose a single chip microcomputer to control our temperature. The temperature 
                control unit of this project is based on the temperature sensor and automatic 
                control algorithm to achieve a constant temperature of 37℃.Temperature control 
                circuit of the working mechanism is: the use of Pt1000 temperature sensors 
                and form A complete set of temperature measuring circuit temperature signal 
                acquisition temperature control unit, the single-chip computer MSP430 with 
                A/D sampling module, software control algorithm is used to calculate the 
                control quantity, and then through the I/O port output power control MOS 
                tube or load switch on and off, output constant current control hardware 
                circuit, and unit of heating and cooling, heating and rely on simple control 
                PID algorithm, guarantee the stability of temperature.The following picture is 
                the image of temperature data fitting using Matlab after the temperature sensor 
                is used to receive the temperature.

            <br>

            <p>
                For colloidal gold detection, after taking a photo with a mobile phone,
                we analyze the R value after the image is collected and compare it with 
                the positive R value to determine the result of the test. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Through the establishment of the small program, we have completed the 
                following functions: reading the fluorescence image, fitting the relationship 
                between image features and solution concentration, outputting the image, 
                and outputting the predicted concentration.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Software interactive applet module: Based on the development of WeChat 
                applet, extract features such as image color (RGB), and use the least 
                square method to perform linear fitting to obtain the relationship between 
                features and concentration. Least squares method is a mathematical optimization 
                technique. It finds the best function match of the data by minimizing the 
                sum of squares of errors. The least square method can be used to easily 
                obtain unknown data, and minimize the sum of squares of errors between 
                the obtained data and the actual data. [7]

                Software interaction process: the mobile phone shoots multiple fluorescent 
                images, the applet reads the images, manually enters the solution concentration, 
                image processing, fitting the relationship between the image characteristics and 
                the solution concentration, the new image is input in the applet, and the 
                predicted concentration is output.The following are the specific functions 
                of WeChat mini program.
