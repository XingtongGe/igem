                Due to the impact of the COVID-19, teams all over the world have encountered 
                many problems. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this year's project, 
                every team is doing a lot of excellent work in their own way. iGEM emphasizes 
                the win-win cooperation between the teams, especially in this year's special 
                circumstances, the teams should strengthen cooperation to overcome difficulties 
                together.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: rgb(237, 88, 58); text-indent: 8rem;">——for team's heritage and IGEMer of the future</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Against this background, team BIT chose to cooperate in-depth with the 
                BIT-China team from the same university to work together more substantively
                 and better to help the two teams.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The BIT team is very interested in the HP work done by team BIT-China in
                 19 years. Because this year iGEM launched the "Two phase" competition mode.
                  Although a team can have different composition in the two years of the 
                  "Two phase", it will be even more important if the team members who 
                  participated in the project in the first year can continue to participate 
                  in the second year. It is possible to make a better project. Therefore, 
                  the team's heritage has become very important. Team BIT-China interviewed a 
                  number of iGEM teams in 2019, designed a series of questions on "team 
                  heritage" and received a lot of answers. In the survey conducted by BIT-China 
                  last year, it was found that many iGEMers have gained a lot from iGEM, and 
                  many people also expressed their willingness to participate in the future iGEM. 
                  But in fact, few iGEMers really stayed in the team and participated in the next 
                  year's project. In the results, many iGEMers mentioned that their team did not 
                  have a corresponding incentive mechanism, and there was no motivation to keep 
                  them. This question is of great interest to team BIT. Therefore, tean BIT got 
                  in touch with team BIT-China this year, hoping to cooperate in this regard.
            </p>    
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Therefore, we want to understand why iGEMers are willing to participate in 
                iGEM.

            <p>
                According to the results of the questionnaire, most iGEMers believe that iGEM 
                is a training for future research work and an excellent opportunity to 
                communicate with more teams. At the same time, most iGEMers don't think it is 
                important to get an award through iGEM for higher education.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Similarly, when asking most iGEMers what they think is the most valuable 
                content they have obtained in iGEM, most iGEMers also think so.Most iGEMers 
                believe that participating in iGEM to train their scientific research 
                capabilities is vital to them.

                Through this questionnaire survey, combined with the results of the 
                BIT_China team in 2019, we believe that if we can establish a "course to iGEM" 
                and "student to teacher" system, it may be possible to increase the team members 
                to participate in another year The passion of iGEM.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Through such research results, team BIT and team BIT-China reached a 
                consensus, hoping to conduct in-depth cooperation in personnel training, 
                help the two teams work better this year, and lay the foundation for the 
                second year of work. For this purpose, team BIT and team BIT-China have 
                carried out a series of related cooperation work at different stages of 
                the project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the early stage of the project, how to make the new team members 
                better understand iGEM so as to better promote the project, BIT and BIT-China 
                jointly organized a series of related courses to train the team members together.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Therefore, during our online process, we prioritize the learning needs of our 
                team members and the students' course expertise. The BIT team combines online 
                learning to be members of the team, students from the college, and students 
                from the entire school. A series of courses combined with professional courses 
                have been prepared to help students learn more professional knowledge from their 
                own knowledge background, and also be able to understand iGEM and synthetic 
                biology in the process. Similarly, these courses were taught by iGEMers from 
                the past team BIT. At the same time, we also held trial lectures in the team 
                members after class to help the team members better understand the content of 
                the course, and at the same time exercise their ability to explain relevant 
                content for new team members in the future. Similarly, we shared these contents
                on the bilibili platform to help more students learn and understand related 
                aspects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the middle of the project, both teams participated in CCIC. Before the game, 
                BIT and BIT-China conducted project exchanges to prepare for this meeting. 
                Team BIT put forward some suggestions for the poster of BIT-China from the 
                perspective of the artist, and helped the BIT-China team to better modify its 
                poster, and finally won the best poster award in CCIC.

                After CCIC, BIT received suggestions from the judge and many other teams. 
                These suggestions were basically focused on the hardware part. Many people 
                think that there is a problem with the related manual centrifugal device. 
                Team BIT-China helps BIT to troubleshoot related issues. BIT adopted the 
                relevant suggestions provided by BIT-China and finally decided to use the 
                fingertip top as the new manual centrifugal device.

                And at the end of the project, every team faced the challenge of WIKI 
                freeze. In previous years, every WIKI of team BIT was made by the 
                team members themselves or by the help of the teammates’ classmates 
                and friends. These tasks not only caused great pressure on the team 
                members, but in fact, we can do better. Therefore, we communicated 
                with the BIT-China team on the production of WIKI. Team BIT-China 
                suggested that we can try to cooperate with students from other 
                professional backgrounds, looking for more professional students 
                to help us achieve more results we want to achieve, and team BIT-China 
                recommended several people from the same project team. These students 
                have undertaken the technical details of the 2020 WIKI of the BIT team, 
                and their work is excellent!
            <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not only in 2020, the BIT team and the BIT-China team will 
                also cooperate more with the laboratory in the future, not 
                only for the production of WIKI, but also a series of lectures 
                to help more people.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not only that, the BIT team and the BIT-China team are also working 
                together to attract students from different backgrounds to become 
                iGEMers and to reserve talents for the future. In order to help more 
                freshmen understand the university, understand the research work, and 
                understand the iGEM, BIT and BIT-China jointly held a coffee metting. 
                Because of the impact of the COVID-19, it is irresponsible to hold large-scale 
                lectures, so the two teams chose Use the form of holding several coffee metting 
                to achieve the effect of popular science publicity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Team BIT and team BIT-China started in-depth cooperation in talent 
                training this year. The two teams will sum up their experience this 
                year and cultivate more professional iGEMers in the iGEM process next year, 
                and make better results!

            <br>

            <p>
                Because of the impact of the COVID-19, many teams have begun to explore new 
                models of popular science publicity and education. Looking at the popular 
                science publicity work of many excellent teams, they are all very good, but
                we found a problem: the popular science publicity work of many excellent 
                teams has not become a "series" but a "brand". At the same time, many teams 
                have been doing lectures for children, high school students, undergraduates 
                and other popular science activities. Although they are necessary and very 
                meaningful, they lack "explosiveness" .As for synthetic biology, a discipline 
                that is relatively "inconspicuous" in the public eye, if it is really to be 
                known to the public, there should be enough big news. At the same time, according 
                to the research report and handbook of team BIT and team SCUT-China, it can be 
                known that in the current science popularization work, many teams are not doing 
                well or even missing some links.

                Team BIT, SCUT-China, and UESTC-Software realized these problems after 
                careful research and several conference calls, and decided to join together 
                to make changes. Therefore, the three teams jointly organized and established 
                the “Science for All Alliance”. In 2020, iGEM Giant Jamboree issued a call 
                for more iGEMers to join us!

                The original intention of the Science for All Alliance was to help each 
                team better conduct popular science publicity activities. The Science 
                for All Alliance hopes to form a community with popular science activities 
                as the main content, and provide a platform to provide more opportunities 
                and inspiration for all teams.

                We temporarily choose this logo as the LOGO of Science for All Alliance. 
                The LOGO adopts the traditional Chinese ink and wash style, and uses the 
                Chinese character "普" as the main element. The word "普" means "universal", 
                which means that everyone has the opportunity to be exposed. This coincides 
                with the theme of our Science for All Alliance. Not only that, the character 
                "普" in Chinese also means "multiple suns are shining in the sky". 
                The Science for All Alliance believes that all teams should unite, 
                just like multiple suns, to jointly carry out more high-quality 
                science popularization work, so that more people can see our glory.

                Science for All Alliance is divided into five functional departments: 
                New Media Department, Outreach Department, Organization Department, 
                General Affairs Department and Mutual Evaluation Committee. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                As a popular science work alliance, the work of the New Media Department 
                is very important. The new media department is divided into two parts: 
                the manuscript group and the video group, which correspond to text-based 
                science content and video-based science content. The manuscript group is 
                not only responsible for producing corresponding text-based science content, 
                but also responsible for contacting other teams and reprinting relevant content. 
                The video team is not only responsible for the production of video science content, 
                but also for contacting other teams to reprint excellent content. The manuscript 
                team is responsible for operating the WeChat account and Zhihu account, and the 
                video team is responsible for operating the bilibili account. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                The outreach part is the international exchange group and the enterprise group. 
                The international exchange team is responsible for getting in touch with excellent 
                foreign teams, and strive to translate their work content to the country, so that 
                more people can benefit. The enterprise group is responsible for contacting domestic 
                and foreign enterprises, media, etc., to provide everyone with a larger and more 
                diverse platform for popular science work.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                The organization part is activity group and cooperation group. The activity group 
                is responsible for organizing larger regional gatherings. The cooperation group is 
                responsible for helping various teams cooperate to carry out a series of branded 
                science popularization activities. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                The General Affairs Department is responsible for the management of the entire 
                alliance, and is responsible for the changes, approval of activities, and fund 
                management.

                At the same time, in order to better help each team improve the quality of 
                science popularization work, Science for All Alliance established a mutual 
                evaluation committee, inviting people with different professional backgrounds 
                and educational backgrounds to join the committee to evaluate each science 
                popularization work. By collecting voices from different angles, we can help 
                more people participate in popular science work, showing the unique diversity 
                and Inclusivity of Science for All Alliance.

            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">
                1.	Use the public account of "Science for All Alliance" to submit 
                video and other promotional materials on major platforms. Having 
                an official account recognized by the platform can better obtain 
                support and allow related works to be seen by more people. At the 
                same time, We hope to get in touch with many outstanding teams from 
                other countries through the name of "Science for All Alliance", and 
                introduce more non-Chinese content translations to China, so that the 
                work of iGEMers can help more people. At the same time, the public 
                account of Science for All Alliance will also back up the materials 
                and content provided by iGEMers.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">
                2. Science for All Alliance hopes to invite experts from all parties, 
                iGEMer and ordinary students to set up committees to evaluate the content 
                published by "Science for All Alliance" on various platforms. 
                Because there are many intellectual problems in the popular science 
                content done by many teams. The Science for All Alliance hopes to help 
                iGEMers participating in the Science for All Alliance to improve the quality 
                of science popularization work by establishing a mutual evaluation system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">
                3. Science for All Alliance will contact enterprises, media, etc. as a group, 
                and provide iGEMers with a larger and more professional platform to conduct popular 
                science publicity activities. At the same time, Science for All Alliance will also 
                hold a series of activities as a group to help each team to preserve and pass on 
                their own special activities into a system, on a large scale.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">
                4.	Science for All Alliance hopes to provide a platform for teams to communicate 
                and cooperate with each other. The Science for All Alliance hopes to build a 
                community, provide opportunities and platforms for cooperation between teams
                with similar ideas, and help everyone better conduct popular science publicity work.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>          
                Science for All Alliance has just started, and we hope that more teams will 
                join us and work together to raise the science popularization work to a new height!
