							Due to the impact of the COVID-19, teams all over the world have encountered many problems.
							In order to ensure the smooth progress of this year's project, every team is doing a lot of 
							excellent work in their own way. iGEM emphasizes the win-win cooperation between the teams, 
							especially in this year's special circumstances, the teams should strengthen cooperation to
							overcome difficulties together.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Against this background, team BIT chose to cooperate in-depth with the BIT-China team from the
							same university to work together more substantively and better to help the two teams.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							The BIT team is very interested in the HP work done by team BIT-China in 19 years.
							Because this year iGEM launched the "Two phase" competition mode. Although a team
							can have different composition in the two years of the "Two phase", it will be even
							more important if the team members who participated in the project in the first year
							can continue to participate in the second year. It is possible to make a better 
							project. Therefore, the team's heritage has become very important. Team BIT-China
							interviewed a number of iGEM teams in 2019, designed a series of questions on "team heritage"
							and received a lot of answers. In the survey conducted by BIT-China last year, it was found
							that many iGEMers have gained a lot from iGEM, and many people also expressed their willingness
							to participate in the future iGEM. But in fact, few iGEMers really stayed in the team and participated
							in the next year's project. In the results, many iGEMers mentioned that their team did not have a 
							corresponding incentive mechanism, and there was no motivation to keep them. This question is of 
							great interest to team BIT. Therefore, tean BIT got in touch with team BIT-China this year, hoping
							to cooperate in this regard.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Therefore, we want to understand why iGEMers are willing to participate in iGEM.
						</p>

						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							According to the results of the questionnaire, most iGEMers believe that iGEM is a training for
							future research work and an excellent opportunity to communicate with more teams. At the same time,
							most iGEMers don't think it is important to get an award through iGEM for higher education.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Similarly, when asking most iGEMers what they think is the most valuable content they have obtained 
							in iGEM, most iGEMers also think so.Most iGEMers believe that participating in iGEM to train their 
							scientific research capabilities is vital to them.
						</p class="a-p">

						</div>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Through this questionnaire survey, combined with the results of the BIT_China team in 2019, 
							we believe that if we can establish a "course to iGEM" and "student to teacher" system, it may
							be possible to increase the team members to participate in another year The passion of iGEM.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Through such research results, team BIT and team BIT-China reached a consensus, hoping to conduct
							in-depth cooperation in personnel training, help the two teams work better this year, and lay the
							foundation for the second year of work. For this purpose, team BIT and team BIT-China have carried
							out a series of related cooperation work at different stages of the project.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							In the early stage of the project, how to make the new team members better understand iGEM so as 
							to better promote the project, BIT and BIT-China jointly organized a series of related courses to
							train the team members together.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Therefore, during our online process, we prioritize the learning needs of our team members and the 
							students' course expertise. The BIT team combines online learning to be members of the team, students
							from the college, and students from the entire school. A series of courses combined with professional
							courses have been prepared to help students learn more professional knowledge from their own knowledge
							background, and also be able to understand iGEM and synthetic biology in the process. Similarly, 
							these courses were taught by iGEMers from the past team BIT. At the same time, we also held trial 
							lectures in the team members after class to help the team members better understand the content of
							the course, and at the same time exercise their ability to explain relevant content for new team 
							members in the future. Similarly, we shared these contents on the bilibili platform to help more
							students learn and understand related aspects.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							In the middle of the project, both teams participated in CCIC. Before the game, BIT and BIT-China 
							conducted project exchanges to prepare for this meeting. Team BIT put forward some suggestions for 
							the poster of BIT-China from the perspective of the artist, and helped the BIT-China team to better 
							modify its poster, and finally won the best poster award in CCIC.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">	
							After CCIC, BIT received suggestions from the judge and many other teams. These suggestions were 
							basically focused on the hardware part. Many people think that there is a problem with the related 
							manual centrifugal device. Team BIT-China helps BIT to troubleshoot related issues. BIT adopted the
							relevant suggestions provided by BIT-China and finally decided to use the fingertip top as the new
							manual centrifugal device.						
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							And at the end of the project, every team faced the challenge of WIKI freeze. In previous years, 
							every WIKI of team BIT was made by the team members themselves or by the help of the teammates’ 
							classmates and friends. These tasks not only caused great pressure on the team members, but in fact,
							we can do better. Therefore, we communicated with the BIT-China team on the production of WIKI. 
							Team BIT-China suggested that we can try to cooperate with students from other professional backgrounds,
							looking for more professional students to help us achieve more results we want to achieve, and team 
							BIT-China recommended several people from the same project team. These students have undertaken the
							technical details of the 2020 WIKI of the BIT team, and their work is excellent!
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Not only in 2020, the BIT team and the BIT-China team will also cooperate more with the laboratory in the 
							future, not only for the production of WIKI, but also a series of lectures to help more people.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Not only that, the BIT team and the BIT-China team are also working together to attract students
							from different backgrounds to become iGEMers and to reserve talents for the future. In order to 
							help more freshmen understand the university, understand the research work, and understand the 
							iGEM, BIT and BIT-China jointly held a coffee metting. Because of the impact of the COVID-19, 
							it is irresponsible to hold large-scale lectures, so the two teams chose Use the form of holding 
							several coffee metting to achieve the effect of popular science publicity.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p class="a-p">
							Team BIT and team BIT-China started in-depth cooperation in talent training this year. 
							The two teams will sum up their experience this year and cultivate more professional 
							iGEMers in the iGEM process next year, and make better results!

							In past competitions, many teams chose to use offline lectures for popular science publicity activities. 
							However, under the influence of the COVID-19, many teams have to choose more to shift their focus to online 
							science popularization. Although in previous years, various teams have carried out a lot of online science 
							promotion work, but many teams have not summarized the relevant experience of national online science 
							popularization, including team BIT and team SCUT-China. Therefore, our two teams have reached a cooperation 
							and conducted a summary of online science popularization experience and future prospects in different aspects, 
							and we hope that our experience can help each team in the future.
