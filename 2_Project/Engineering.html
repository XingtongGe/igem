                        In this project, a nucleic acid aptamer replacement system is used to design an aptamer 
                        replacement system for the N protein of the new coronavirus to convert protein signals into 
                        nucleic acid signals. Use biotin-streptavidin to bind magnetic beads on one end of the nucleic 
                        acid aptamer, which can be fixed by a magnet, and the aptamer can bind to its complementary 
                        chain through the hydrogen bond force of complementary base pairing. The target protein is 
                        stored in the aptamer, and the protein will bind to the aptamer. Since the force between the 
                        protein and the aptamer is greater than the hydrogen bond force, the complementary chain is 
                        released, thereby achieving the purpose of converting the protein signal into a nucleic acid 
                        signal. This method is simpler and easier to operate, and the cost is much more considerable, 
                        and the detection accuracy is more accurate than only nucleic acid detection, which reduces 
                        false — the probability of negative or false positive. Aiming at the binding length of the aptamer 
                        and the complementary chain, we designed the complementary chain S1 and S2 in the experiment. 
                        The long chain complementary chain S2 reacts well after competing with CKMB. Its length is 25 
                        bp and its sequence is 5' -FAM-CCCAACCCCCTAAAAGCATCCTCCG, this result proves that the nucleic 
                        acid aptamer has been successfully obtained.

                        the previous step of nucleic acid aptamer replacement. We finally use colloidal gold to detect 
                        the experimental products. We also successfully carried out the amplification experiment and got

                        Our temperature control module can provide our amplification with stable temperature, the 
                        commonly used PCR amplification on the temperature change after heating denaturation and 
                        annealing of two steps, which requires the device in the temperature control needs to have 
                        the ability of rapid heating and cooling, which means you need larger space to provide 
                        equipment heat dissipation of the environment, but also has great power to provide our 
                        equipment.However, because of our need for miniaturization and portability, we did not adopt 
                        PCR as our amplification technology. Instead, we adopted an amplification method with low 
                        requirement for temperature change to meet our demand for portability. This amplification 
                        method only needs to be amplified at constant temperature.

                        Since the amplification temperature we needed was constant, we initially considered whether we 
                        could use human body to amplify the nucleic acid temperature of our chip. However, considering 
                        the biosafety and stable temperature required for amplification, we looked elsewhere.Finally, 
                        we chose a single chip microcomputer to control our temperature. The temperature control unit 
                        of this project is based on the temperature sensor and automatic control algorithm to achieve 
                        a constant temperature of 37℃.Temperature control circuit of the working mechanism is: the use 
                        of Pt1000 temperature sensors and form A complete set of temperature measuring circuit 
                        temperature signal acquisition temperature control unit, the single-chip computer MSP430 with 
                        A/D sampling module, software control algorithm is used to calculate the control quantity, 
                        and then through the I/O port output power control MOS tube or load switch on and off, output 
                        constant current control hardware circuit, and unit of heating and cooling, heating and rely 
                        on simple control PID algorithm, guarantee the stability of temperature.The following picture 
                        is the image of temperature data fitting using Matlab after the temperature sensor is used to 
                        receive the temperature.

                        force of the liquid flow. The flow velocity can be adjusted and controlled by changing the 
                        rotation speed of the chip and designing different channel configurations.

                    <p>
                        The special feature of our centrifugal microfluidic chip is that it does not use a motor, but 
                        uses a pushing hand to drive the microfluidic chip to rotate, so as to construct a simulated 
                        gravity field, that is, the centrifugal field, and the flow is controlled by the volume force 
                        acting on the material in the centrifugal microfluidic chip, so as to get rid of the complicated 
                        laboratory equipment. Centrifugal microfluidic chip can be designed as a closed system, which 
                        means that the centrifugal microfluidic chip can realize the functions of pre-storage, release, 
                        mixing and reaction of reagents or samples, which greatly enhances the convenience of the chip. 
                        One of the characteristics of centrifugal force drive is that the power is applied to all the 
                        liquid flows on the chip. The advantage of centrifugal force is that it can provide the driving 
                        force of all the structural units on the chip at the same time, which is of great significance 
                        for the high-throughput analysis of microfluidic chips; Due to the characteristics of centrifugal 
                        motion, centrifugal microfluidic chips usually build flow channels and chambers on a CD-shaped 
                        disk, and the radian of each part needs to be adjusted or designed according to the rotation 
                        center. In the centrifugal microfluidic chip, the volume force can be controlled by controlling 
                        the rotation speed and angular acceleration, and driven by the volume force, the liquid in the 
                        flow channel will flow by itself, and because there is no other liquid flowing in, the 
                        centrifugal microfluidic chip needs to open a hole to let the air enter the original space of 
                        the substitute liquid, so as to avoid the vacuum force restricting the liquid flow. Therefore, 
                        unlike the continuous liquid flow in other microfluidic chips, the flow in centrifugal 
                        microfluidic chips is mostly gas-liquid two-phase flow.

                        Based on the previous model construction, we have produced a centrifugal microfluidic chip 
                        prototype, as shown in the figure below. Instead of installing gaskets in this chip, we rotate 
                        directly with a solid center shaft. Preliminary tests show that the chip can maintain a 
                        basically stable rotation and speed with the handheld center shaft. The following is the 
                        experimental operation:

                    <p>
                        ①In order to simulate the fluid flow during the actual rotation of the centrifugal chip, we 
                        injected 100μL of pigment into the amplification chamber of the chip, and placed a test strip 
                        in the chip test strip area in advance. It is evaluated by visually observing the pigment flow. 
                        Figure 8 shows that the pigment can be injected normally without entering the test strip area;

                    <p>
                        ②Turn the chip upside down to deposit the pigment in the amplification chamber on the other 
                        side of the chip chamber, and at the same time turn the centrifugal chip to rotate around the 
                        central axis. The liquid in the amplification chamber enters the test strip chamber under the 
                        action of centrifugal force, and covers the entire test strip under the capillary action of the 
                        test strip. By observing the liquid flow during the rotation process and the pigment diffusion 
                        of the test strip, it can be proved that the centrifugal force provided by the toggle chip can 
                        drive the liquid in the amplification chamber into the detection area of the test strip.

                        Through the construction of the Mini Program, we have completed the following functions: 
                        reading images, fitting image features and solution concentration, output image, output 
                        predictive concentration.

                        Software interaction module: based on the development of WeChat Mini Program, extract image 
                        color (RGB) and other features, use the least squares method to linearly fit to obtain the 
                        relationship between feature and concentration.

                        The least squares method (also known as the least square method) is a mathematical optimization 
                        technology. It matches the best function of finding data by minimizing the square of the error. 
                        The least squares method can be used to easily find unknown data and minimize the sum of the 
                        error between the obtained data and the actual data.
