                            The purpose of the biological module is to construct a rapid, stable, high-accuracy
                            and high-sensitivity detection method for the new coronavirus markers, and finally
                            realize the real-time detection of the new coronavirus. At the same time, the biological
                            module undertakes the function of converting biological signals into optical signals.
                            The biological part of this project is mainly divided into four parts: sample
                            pre-processing,
                            nucleic acid aptamer replacement, RCA isothermal amplification and nucleic acid signal
                            detection. The following figure is the experimental flow chart, that is, the obtained N
                            protein generates complementary chains by competing with the aptamer, and then the nucleic
                            acid signal is amplified by the RCA isothermal amplification technology, and then
                            transferred
                            to the test strip for colloidal gold detection. According to the above scheme, we designed
                            relevant pre-experiments for simulation verification in the laboratory stage. For details,
                            see the subsidiary section of the BIO section.

                            In our project, a microfluidic chip driven by a fidget spinner is used as a reaction carrier
                            to
                            realize the biological part. The manufacturing material is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA),
                            and
                            the chip is assembled by hot-key bonding method. The overall frame of our microfluidic chip
                            can
                            be approximately regarded as a rectangle, the turning radius is slightly smaller than the
                            average
                            length of the adult hand gap, and there is a rotating shaft composed of a roller bearing and
                            a gasket
                            in the center of the chip. By holding the gasket in the center and rotating the chip with
                            the other
                            hand, the centrifugal force generated by the rotation can be used to drive the liquid path
                            of the
                            microfluidic chip.

                            According to the biological part of the detection process, on the basis of the microfluidic
                            chip,
                            we successively realize the isothermal amplification of nucleic acid in the isothermal
                            amplification
                            area, and realize the visual signal conversion based on the lateral chromatography test
                            strip in the
                            signal detection area. Finally, the mobile phone support module optically detects the signal
                            on the test
                            strip, and performs subsequent signal processing. Specifically, on the test strip, our
                            project adopts a
                            signal conversion method based on colloidal gold technology, and compares the colloidal gold
                            degree with
                            the standard positive result through the color reaction to obtain the reaction result.

                            The temperature control module is mainly composed of a single-chip microcomputer, a ceramic
                            heater and a
                            thermistor. The combination of these three can meet our temperature requirements for RCA
                            reactions.

                            <br>

                            In the optical signal visual detection part, we use the MINA framework to build a WeChat
                            mini program to
                            take pictures and upload the colloidal gold test strips, as well as reading the colloidal
                            gold image with
                            the software, and fitting the relationship between the image characteristics and the
                            concentration of the
                            test object, and finally get the virus test results.

                            According to the problems of the current new coronavirus detection platform, such as
                            cumbersome operation, large size, need to be equipped with professional operators, and
                            limited to use in the laboratory, this project is designed as a visual detection hardware
                            equipment that can be applied to community, rural hospitals and families, which is of great
                            significance in major public health safety, especially in the outbreak of epidemic.

                            <br>
                            Therefore, we have carried out a series of human practice research and safety assessment.
                            Through visiting community doctors, communities in high-risk areas and designated hospitals
                            to investigate their recognition and feasibility of the project, the results show that the
                            project has practical significance and is conducive to future promotion. At the same time,
                            according to the requirements of the national medical and health system, the safety of the
                            project is also considered. In the clinical validation phase of the project, virus signals
                            need to be detected, so these clinical verification work will be handed over to a special
                            laboratory for implementation. In the future plan of project implementation, we will
                            evaluate the accuracy, safety and stability of virus detection to improve the credibility of
                            the project.

                            Novel coronavirus protein markers were detected in the biological part after the importance
                            of this project was determined. The new functions of aptamer replacement system, RCA
                            isothermal amplification technology and colloidal gold strip test were used to realize the
                            three functions of protein aptamer replacement, nucleic acid signal amplification and
                            nucleic acid signal detection. For the hardware part, a microfluidic chip matching with the
                            biological part is designed, and all aspects of the detection of new coronavirus are planned
                            to be integrated into the chip. At the same time, the signal detection part plans to use
                            external equipment to build and design a fluorescence detection unit based on the mobile
                            phone platform, that is, in the dark environment, use the mobile phone flash to excite
                            fluorescence, detect the photos taken and analyze the R value of colloidal gold (Figure). In
                            terms of fluorescence detection method, inclined incidence fluorescence detection method
                            which is conducive to miniaturization is proposed. SolidWorks is used for 3D modeling, and
                            the box with microfluidic chip and mobile phone bracket matching different mobile phone
                            models are designed to achieve the goal of the initial project. In addition, due to the
                            tedious operation of pretreatment, i.e. cell lysis and other steps of the sample to be
                            tested in the user's use process, we have increased the chip chamber design to reduce the
                            impact on the product. Before the implementation, we considered the above design and thought
                            that the integration of various technologies was of great significance, and the combination
                            of centrifugal chip module and mobile phone support module was very convenient for users.

                            <br>
                            In the initial stage of the project, we plan to use RPA-Isothermal amplification technology
                            to amplify the multi nucleic acid signals obtained in the sample pre-processing stage for
                            subsequent detection, including the extraction and purification of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid
                            signal (nucleic acid detection) and the complementary chain signal (protein detection) of
                            2019-nCoV characteristic protein through aptamer replacement. However, in the actual
                            experiment, we found that the length of complementary chain obtained by aptamer replacement
                            in protein detection is very short, far less than the length of primer required by RPA,
                            which shows that our project design has flaws.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After investigation, we decided to replace RPA technology with HCR technology and RCA
                            technology. On the basis of retaining the advantages of RPA technology, such as isothermal,
                            rapid, efficient and convenient, the two technologies can greatly expand long and short
                            chain nucleic acid fragments in a short period of time, which is very consistent with the
                            needs of our project. Therefore, we initially decided to use RCA technology to amplify
                            complementary chain in protein detection and HCR technology to amplify nucleic acid signal
                            in nucleic acid detection.

                            <h3>Question1：</h3>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the early stage of our project, the design of microfluidic chip tends to use the pulling
                            whistle driven centrifugal chip based on the "pulling whistle principle". The spring rope is
                            pulled by external force to switch between the "winding" and "unfolding" states, and the
                            centrifugal disc chip is pulled to produce certain rotation speed and centrifugal force.
                            However, after our later model construction and experimental verification, the centrifugal
                            chip driven by pulling whistle has a considerable defect, that is, it cannot guarantee the
                            horizontal balance of the chip during centrifugation, and it is very unstable in the process
                            of rotation, which will lead to tremor and leakage.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We improved the original design of pulling whistle to a microfluidic chip driven by fidget
                            spinner. The centrifugal force generated by the rotation of fidget spinner can also drive
                            the flow of liquid well. Because of the stable orbit of the shaft, it can guarantee our
                            stability in the horizontal direction.

                            The instruments used by the iGEM-BIT team in the 2020 project will be consist of our own
                            designed fingertip gyro-driven microfluidic chips, lateral flow tomographic strips,
                            temperature control modules, optical sensing modules, and intelligent external machine frame
                            structures. The goal of this project is to design a palm-held laboratory capable of
                            detecting 2019-nCoV with high accuracy and throughput.
                            In the process of the project development, we designed and completed the following

                            iGEMer not only needs to achieve results in the field of synthetic biology, but also needs
                            to do more work. Therefore, the BIT team hopes to expand the meaning of human practice so
                            that our work can have a more profound impact.

                            T The BIT team, SCUT-China and UESTC-Software found problems in popular science work after
                            careful research and several conference calls, and decided to join together to make changes.
                            Therefore, the three teams jointly organized and established the “Science for All Alliance”.
                            In 2020, iGEM Giant Jamboree issued a call for more iGEMers to join us!
                            The original intention of the Science for All Alliance was to help each team better conduct
                            popular science publicity activities. The Science for All Alliance hopes to form a community
                            with popular science activities as the main content, and provide a platform to provide more
                            opportunities and inspiration for all teams.

                            Because of the impact of the COVID-19, team BIT begin to think about how to carry out
                            related work. In 2020, China will comprehensively build a well-off society. The members of
                            team BIT are also thinking about how to use their own strength to contribute to the country.
                            Therefore, team BIT got in touch with the Escort, a club of Beijing Institute of Technology.
                            They are a team of volunteers dedicated to supporting teaching activities. Team BIT got in
                            touch with them, hoping to jointly promote synthetic biology promotion lectures in the
                            future, and send knowledge and strength to more children who have no chance to contact
                            relevant knowledge.
