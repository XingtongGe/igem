                            The purpose of the biological module is to construct a rapid, stable, high-accuracy
                            and high-sensitivity detection method for the new coronavirus markers, and finally
                            realize the real-time detection of the new coronavirus. At the same time, the biological
                            module undertakes the function of converting biological signals into optical signals.
                            The biological part of this project is mainly divided into four parts: sample
                            pre-processing,
                            nucleic acid aptamer replacement, RCA isothermal amplification and nucleic acid signal
                            detection. The following figure is the experimental flow chart, that is, the obtained N
                            protein generates complementary chains by competing with the aptamer, and then the nucleic
                            acid signal is amplified by the RCA isothermal amplification technology, and then
                            transferred
                            to the test strip for colloidal gold detection. According to the above scheme, we designed
                            relevant pre-experiments for simulation verification in the laboratory stage. For details,
                            see the subsidiary section of the BIO section.

                            In our project, a microfluidic chip driven by a fidget spinner is used as a reaction carrier
                            to
                            realize the biological part. The manufacturing material is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA),
                            and
                            the chip is assembled by hot-key bonding method. The overall frame of our microfluidic chip
                            can
                            be approximately regarded as a rectangle, the turning radius is slightly smaller than the
                            average
                            length of the adult hand gap, and there is a rotating shaft composed of a roller bearing and
                            a gasket
                            in the center of the chip. By holding the gasket in the center and rotating the chip with
                            the other
                            hand, the centrifugal force generated by the rotation can be used to drive the liquid path
                            of the
                            microfluidic chip.

                            <br>

                            According to the biological part of the detection process, on the basis of the microfluidic
                            chip,
                            we successively realize the isothermal amplification of nucleic acid in the isothermal
                            amplification
                            area, and realize the visual signal conversion based on the lateral chromatography test
                            strip in the
                            signal detection area. Finally, the mobile phone support module optically detects the signal
                            on the test
                            strip, and performs subsequent signal processing. Specifically, on the test strip, our
                            project adopts a
                            signal conversion method based on colloidal gold technology, and compares the colloidal gold
                            degree with
                            the standard positive result through the color reaction to obtain the reaction result.

                            The temperature control module is mainly composed of a single-chip microcomputer, a ceramic
                            heater and a
                            thermistor. The combination of these three can meet our temperature requirements for RCA
                            reactions.

                            <br>

                            In the optical signal visual detection part, we use the MINA framework to build a WeChat
                            mini program to
                            take pictures and upload the colloidal gold test strips, as well as reading the colloidal
                            gold image with
                            the software, and fitting the relationship between the image characteristics and the
                            concentration of the
                            test object, and finally get the virus test results.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the initial stage of the project, we plan to use RPA-Isothermal amplification technology
                            to amplify the multi nucleic acid signals obtained in the sample pre-processing stage for
                            subsequent detection, including the extraction and purification of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid
                            signal (nucleic acid detection) and the complementary chain signal (protein detection) of
                            2019-nCoV characteristic protein through aptamer replacement. However, in the actual
                            experiment, we found that the length of complementary chain obtained by aptamer replacement
                            in protein detection is very short, far less than the length of primer required by RPA,
                            which shows that our project design has flaws.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After investigation, we decided to replace RPA technology with HCR technology and RCA
                            technology. On the basis of retaining the advantages of RPA technology, such as isothermal,
                            rapid, efficient and convenient, the two technologies can greatly expand long and short
                            chain nucleic acid fragments in a short period of time, which is very consistent with the
                            needs of our project. Therefore, we initially decided to use RCA technology to amplify
                            complementary chain in protein detection and HCR technology to amplify nucleic acid signal
                            in nucleic acid detection.

                            <h3>Question1：</h3>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the early stage of our project, the design of microfluidic chip tends to use the pulling
                            whistle driven centrifugal chip based on the "pulling whistle principle". The spring rope is
                            pulled by external force to switch between the "winding" and "unfolding" states, and the
                            centrifugal disc chip is pulled to produce certain rotation speed and centrifugal force.
                            However, after our later model construction and experimental verification, the centrifugal
                            chip driven by pulling whistle has a considerable defect, that is, it cannot guarantee the
                            horizontal balance of the chip during centrifugation, and it is very unstable in the process
                            of rotation, which will lead to tremor and leakage.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Solution：</h3>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We improved the original design of pulling whistle to a microfluidic chip driven by fidget
                            spinner. The centrifugal force generated by the rotation of fidget spinner can also drive
                            the flow of liquid well. Because of the stable orbit of the shaft, it can guarantee our
                            stability in the horizontal direction.

                            The instruments used by the iGEM-BIT team in the 2020 project will be consist of our own
