                <h3>Question1:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the initial stage of the project, we plan to use RPA-Isothermal amplification
                    technology to amplify the multi nucleic acid signals obtained in the sample
                    pre-processing stage for subsequent detection, including the extraction and
                    purification of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid signal (nucleic acid detection) and the
                    complementary chain signal (protein detection) of 2019-nCoV characteristic protein 
                    through aptamer replacement. However, in the actual experiment, we found that the 
                    length of complementary chain obtained by aptamer replacement in protein detection 
                    is very short, far less than the length of primer required by RPA, which shows that 
                    our project design has flaws.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    After investigation, we decided to replace RPA technology with HCR technology and RCA 
                    technology. On the basis of retaining the advantages of RPA technology, such as isothermal, 
                    rapid, efficient and convenient, the two technologies can greatly expand long and short chain 
                    nucleic acid fragments in a short period of time, which is very consistent with the needs of 
                    our project. Therefore, we initially decided to use RCA technology to amplify complementary 
                    chain in protein detection and HCR technology to amplify nucleic acid signal in nucleic acid detection.
                </p>

                <h3>Question2:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the initial project, one of the important reasons for us to use RPA technology is to use RPA 
                    to amplify the nucleic acid signal in the Sherlock technology used in the nucleic acid signal 
                    detection and energy exchange part. However, due to the change of nucleic acid amplification 
                    method in the first problem, our Sherlock technology has been greatly affected, and we have no 
                    previous experimental accumulation of this technology, so the experimental operation is also 
                    very difficult.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    After careful consideration, in order to cope with the change of nucleic acid amplification mode 
                    in question 1, we decided to delete the Sherlock technology of nucleic acid signal detection and 
                    energy exchange, and directly use the lateral chromatography strip to detect our amplification 
                    results. In this way, we can avoid the huge risk that Sherlock technology may bring, and also can 
                    reduce the experimental cost and unnecessary waste of human and financial resources.

            <div class="PS">
                <h3>Question3:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the middle and later stage of the project implementation, we found that the nucleic 
                    acid detection pathway in the project has been well studied in the world, so there is 
                    no outstanding innovation point, which cannot reflect the progress of the project.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    Since there are no outstanding innovations in the nucleic acid detection pathway, we 
                    think it is unnecessary to repeat the mature experiments. At the same time, in order 
                    to save time and cost, we finally decided to delete the nucleic acid detection pathway 
                    to highlight the protein detection pathway in the project. Different from the nucleic 
                    acid detection pathway, aptamer is used to convert the non amplified protein signal 
                    into the amplified nucleic acid signal, which greatly improves the accuracy of detection 
                    and breaks the traditional protein detection method based on antigen antibody binding. 
                    Finally, we decided to use HCR and RCA technology to amplify the protein detection pathway, 
                    and use two kinds of lateral chromatography strips (colloidal gold, fluorescent microspheres) 
                    to detect our amplification results. We hope to compare and analyze the results through 2 * 2 
                    nucleic acid amplification detection mode to obtain more accurate detection results.

                <p>
                    In the early stage of our project, the design of microfluidic chip tends to use the pulling

                    is pulled by external force to switch between the "winding" and "unfolding" states, and the 
                    centrifugal disc chip is pulled to produce certain rotation speed and centrifugal force. 
                    However, after our later model construction and experimental verification, the centrifugal 
                    chip driven by pulling whistle has a considerable defect, that is, it cannot guarantee the 
                    horizontal balance of the chip during centrifugation, and it is very unstable in the process 
                    of rotation, which will lead to tremor and leakage.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    We improved the original design of pulling whistle to a microfluidic chip driven by fidget 
                    spinner. The centrifugal force generated by the rotation of fidget spinner can also drive 
                    the flow of liquid well. Because of the stable orbit of the shaft, it can guarantee our 
                    stability in the horizontal direction.

                <p>
                    According to our original design, all our biological treatment parts will be integrated 
                    in the chamber of the microfluidic chip. However, considering the simplification of the 
                    microfluidic chip structure and meeting the detection needs of POCT, we should try to 
                    avoid using manual or motor-driven micro valves, but this means that the reactions in 
                    the microfluidic chips may interfere with each other during multiple driving.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    Because we cannot solve the problem of the multiple driving of microfluidic chip in a 
                    short time, we plan to do split cell and convert protein signal into nucleic acid signal 
                    these two steps before the injection of microfluidic chip.

                <p>
                    The paramagnetic particle method mainly includes four steps: pyrolysis, combination, 
                    washing and elution, and the conditions of each step are stringent. After literature 
                    research, we found that the operation steps of paramagnetic particle method in microfluidic 
                    chip is complex, and it is difficult to realize in the microfluidic chip in this project.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    At present, the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction by paramagnetic particle method 
                    in chip is not high. At the same time, through the experiment in microfluidic chip, we 
                    find that the amplified signal without paramagnetic particle method can meet the needs 
                    of detection, so the step of nucleic acid signal extraction can be deleted.

                    Based on the above research, this project changes to conduct the sample pre-processing 
                    process for protein signal such as aptamer replacement before sample’s injection after 
                    cell structure destruction. In the pretreatment process of reagent consumables, we only 
                    embed the strip in the centrifuge chip, and other reaction steps are planned to be completed 
                    before injection. In the final delivery to the user, the user needs to carry out the sample 
                    pre-processing process.

                <p>
                    In our design, the power supply is directly from the mobile phones to the external devices. 
                    However, after our research and analysis, it is impossible for mobile phones to directly power 
                    external devices or units. For example, the micro USB interface is common in mobile phones, 
                    however, according to international standards, it is impossible to supply power from the mobile 
                    phone to other devices. If the power supply to the external equipment is strengthened through 
                    the earphone jack of mobile phone, only small current and small voltage can be output. At present
                    , 3.5mm headphone interface has been gradually replaced. To sum up, it is not easy to use the mobile 
                    phone to charge the device in reverse.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to solve the above problems, we design two schemes: the first scheme is to use the 
                    external power bank to supply power, which is not only easy to get, but also easy to carry and 
                    use. The design of the external device is also very simple, only need a USB interface to connect 
                    the charging device. Another design method is to select a battery that can power the device and 
                    design it on the same device as other modules. The battery can choose 18650 lithium battery which 
                    is commonly used in the market.

                            In the experiment, we use a positive photoresist, which can dissolve in the developing

                            ultraviolet irradiation, while the unexposed part is insoluble in the developing solution 
                            and remains on the substrate. The same pattern on the mask will be copied to the substrate 
                            to complete the fabrication of the designed chamber and channel.

                            <p>
                                (1) The mask is cut and cleaned (firstly, it is cleaned with tap water, sprayed with 
                                detergent, cleaned with detergent, then cleaned with deionized water, and finally 
                                dried with a blower), which is convenient for subsequent experiments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (2) The underlying structure of the photogel chip:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    ① Use a little photogel at the diagonal point of the mask frame, and solidify it 
                                    with ultraviolet light to make the mask frame solidify stably on the glass slide. 
                                    Add about 0.2 ml of photogel into the mask frame, cover with the mask, and push 
                                    the photogel under the mask evenly with tweezers to fill the mask frame, and use 
                                    the tweezers to drive away the bubbles under the mask. According to the thickness 
                                    of the photogel tiles, the photogel is fixed by irradiating them with ultraviolet 
                                    light for 25s-30s.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ②After the photocoagulation is solidified, gently pick up a corner with tweezers 
                                    to observe whether the photocoagulation has solidified on the surface of the 
                                    glass sheet. If there is no change of angle to observe, if it has solidified on 
                                    the surface of the glass sheet, then tear off the mask of the surface quickly 
                                    with tweezers.
                                </p>

                                    ③Drop about 0.2 ml of photogel on the solidified surface again, and lay the mask 
                                    on the track so that there are no bubbles between the mask and the underlying 
                                    photogel. Special attention should be paid to aligning the mask tracks of each 
                                    layer. The photogel was fixed by irradiation with ultraviolet light for 10s-15s.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ④After photocoagulation, gently pick up a corner and observe whether the 
                                    photocoagulant is solidified on the surface of the underlying photocoagulant. 
                                    If it has solidified, gently tear off the mask with tweezers. The process of 
                                    tearing off the mask should not be too rapid and should be gentle.
                                </p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                (3) Use a little photogel at the diagonal point of the mask, fix the mask frame on 
                                the chromium plate, and fix the photogel with ultraviolet light. Repeat the above 
                                steps to fix the second mask frame on the original basis. After fixing the mask 
                                frame, point about 0.5 ml of photogel, cover it with a mask, try to make no bubbles 
                                between the mask and the photogel, and tear the mask off the chrome plate slowly 
                                with ultraviolet light for 30 s.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (4) Clean and dry the mask and glass plate with the photogel lotion, align and bond 
                                them together under the microscope, irradiate them with ultraviolet light for about 
                                30 seconds, and tear off the mask quickly after confirming that the two have bonded. 
                                Carefully observe to determine whether the chip channel is smooth and whether the 
                                chamber track is blocked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (5) Intubation: put the gasket made into the intubation of the chip, insert the thin 
                                tube that has roughened the orifice into the chip, fix it with photogel, and 
                                illuminate it with ultraviolet light for 5 s. Repeat the above steps to intubate 
                                each tube in turn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (6) Edge sealing: the edges of the chip were sealed sequentially with photogel and 
                                illuminated with ultraviolet light for 30 s. Finally, place a 50 degree oven 
                                overnight.
