                    Due to the impact of the COVID-19, in the early stages
                    of this year’s competition, offline lectures and other
                    forms that were often held in the past could not be carried out,
                    so we began to focus on using online new media methods to
                    promote related science.

                    In the past work, the new media platforms commonly used
                    by the BIT team are Weibo, bilibili, WeChat and twitter.
                    However, except for the WeChat, the science popularization
                    effects of other platforms are average, so this year the BIT
                    team hopes to investigate the science popularization environment
                    of the two platforms Weibo and bilibili through specific research
                    reports to summarize the past experience of the BIT team's online
                    publicity work , And decides the online work center of the BIT
                    team in the future, and hopes to provide help to other iGEM teams
                    in China through this research report, and help other teams better
                    conduct popular science publicity work.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    In the report, the BIT team conducted research on Weibo and the
                    bilibili platform. Compared with Wechat, these two platforms
                    can allow more people to access our popular science content,
                    and the audience is wider than wechat.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    Weibo is a traditional platform with text as its main carrier,
                    and the content of popular science is basically text + pictures.
                    After investigation, the BIT team found that the Weibo platform is
                    not suitable for science popularization. After conducting research
                    using the more famous Weibo account @Doctor Dingxiang as a typical
                    example, we found that the Weibo platform does not provide relevant
                    support for popular science content due to its own business reasons,
                    and will also invade the survival of popular science content due to
                    other aspects. space. Therefore, the BIT team seeks a platform that is
                    more suitable for the release of popular science content.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    For this reason, the BIT team deliberately investigated the bilibili.
                    According to research, although there are not a big UP who He is doing
                    popular science work in igem, synthetic biology or medicine and have a
                    large number of fans, the same video playback volume is relatively low,
                    but it can be obtained through “likes /watching”, most of the videos are
                    about 0.1, which means that one in every 10 people thinks this video is
                    useful to them, far exceeding the order of Weibo. Similarly, in 2020.6.5,
                    the bilibili opened a new partition for the first time: the knowledge
                    zone, and a series of related activities such as the "knowledge sharing
                    officer" to support the newcomer UP master to create content.

                    We temporarily choose this logo as the LOGO of Science for All Alliance. The LOGO adopts the
                    traditional Chinese ink and wash style, and uses the Chinese character "普" as the main element. The
                    word "普" means "universal", which means that everyone has the opportunity to be exposed. This
                    coincides with the theme of our Science for All Alliance. Not only that, the character "普" in
                    Chinese also means "multiple suns are shining in the sky". The Science for All Alliance believes
                    that all teams should unite, just like multiple suns, to jointly carry out more high-quality science
                    popularization work, so that more people can see our glory.
                    Science for All Alliance has a complete organizational structure to carry out all aspects of work.

                    correspond to text-based science content and video-based science content. The manuscript group is
                    not only responsible for producing corresponding text-based science content, but also responsible
                    for contacting other teams and reprinting relevant content. The video team is not only responsible
                    for the production of video science content, but also for contacting other teams to reprint
                    excellent content. The manuscript team is responsible for operating the WeChat account and Zhihu

                    in the human practice conducted by the team BIT_China in 2019 aroused our interest.
                    The results of the team BIT_China show that most of the iGEMers believe that participating
                    in iGEM has brought them a lot of help in study and life, and many people were willing to
                    continue the next year's competition at the beginning, but most of them failed to participate.

                    do not have effective methods to motivate team members to stay. This made the BIT team think
                    about how to make the team members willing to stay and how to motivate the team members.
                    Therefore, we want to understand why iGEMers are willing to participate in iGEM.

                    with more teams. At the same time, most iGEMers don't think it is important to get

                    to participate in this activity and exercise together. At the same time,
                    during the break, we also introduced the team BIT's project this year for
                    the students who came to watch the game, listened to their opinions and
                    suggestions, and introduced them to iGEM and synthetic biology. Because
                    these students have different professional backgrounds, we hope that through
                    such an activity, we can help more students understand igem, understand
                    synthetic biology, and bring the intersection of thinking between different
                    disciplines in the future.

                    In order to better attract students from different professional backgrounds
                    to learn about iGEM and synthetic biology, and to introduce iGEM to new
                    students who have just come university, team BIT specially carried out a
                    popular science promotion at the club’s recruitment activities. We not only
                    introduced to freshmen, we also attracted students from other clubs around to
                    listen to our introduction to this year's projects. Everyone is very interested
                    in our project and also asked us to explain the projects we have done in the past,
                    so we also introduced last year's projects and introduced the hardware work of
                    team BIT. These freshmen and schoolmates from other clubs come from different professional
                    backgrounds. We hope to attract more by introducing the characteristics of the iGEM
                    competition, introducing the characteristics of the BIT team's biology and hardware
                    combination, and introducing what we are doing in the past and now. We want this
                    students will participate in the iGEM competition, participate in the research in
                    the field of synthetic biology, and bring new impetus to the development of synthetic
                    biology with more professional thinking methods.

                    Also, we do a series of coffee time for freshman. We held these lectures with BIT-China
                    to help freshmen learn more about the iGEM competition through the presentations of the
                    two teams. Help students who want to understand synthetic biology find a research direction
                    that is more suitable for them.

                    Therefore, it can be concluded that in terms of education, the 2020 BIT team worked in three area:
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    First, the BIT team hopes to work with other teams to jointly write related
                    science popularization platforms, popular science content, and popular science
                    recommendation manuals related to popular science audiences, so as to help each
                    team better conduct popular science publicity work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    Second, the BIT team hopes to increase the enthusiasm of the
                    team members for participating in the next year by establishing
                    a system of "courses to iGEM" and "students to teachers", and to
                    promote related science popularization work derived from these
                    systems for the next year Train iGEMer in advance.

                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: .9rem">
                    Third, the BIT team hopes to introduce more students with different
                    professional backgrounds to attract students with more academic
                    backgrounds to participate in iGEM and provide more inspiration.
